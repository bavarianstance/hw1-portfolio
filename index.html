	<p class="aboutme">
		Calvin is an aspiring web developer with a background in sales, specializing in cool start up technologies. He has a certain affinity for fine European automobiles and can be considered a horsepower freak. 
	</p>

	<p class="aboutme">
		When he's not coding, he likes to play video games (PC mostly). Favorite games right now would be Insurgency Sandstorm and Natural Selection 2. He also recently built out an sizeable 34 GPU mining farm for cryptocurrency. Since bitcoin is now in the toilet, he didn't get rich quick unfortunately.
	</p>
	<p class="aboutme">
		After graduating, he would ideally like to land a more technical customer facing role, perhaps technical customer success or solutions architecture down the road. He spends his time exploring the city, trying out new cuisines and beers, wrenching on his cars and motorcycle and setting high scores.
